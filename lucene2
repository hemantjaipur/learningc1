Choose Elasticsearch if:
You need a ready-to-use solution with minimal development effort.
You require scalability for large catalogs and high traffic.
You want features like faceted search, autocomplete, and aggregations for filtering and sorting products.
You prefer a RESTful API for easy integration with your front-end and other services.
You need monitoring and analytics tools (e.g., Kibana).


Choose Lucene if:
You want full control over the search engine and are comfortable with low-level development.
Your application is small-scale and does not require distributed search.
You have specific requirements that need custom scoring algorithms or custom analyzers.
You want to embed the search engine directly into your application without running a separate service.



1. Faceted Search
Faceted search allows users to filter results based on predefined categories or attributes (e.g., product category, price range, brand).

Steps to Implement Faceted Search
Index Facet Fields:

Add fields like category, price, and brand to the Lucene index.
Use KeywordField for categorical data and LongField for numeric data.



doc.add(new KeywordField("category", product.getCategory(), Field.Store.YES));
doc.add(new KeywordField("brand", product.getBrand(), Field.Store.YES));
doc.add(new LongField("price", product.getPrice(), Field.Store.YES));



Query for Facets:

Use TermQuery for categorical facets and RangeQuery for numeric facets.



Query categoryQuery = new TermQuery(new Term("category", "Electronics"));
Query priceQuery = LongField.newRangeQuery("price", 500, 1000); // Price range: 500-1000
BooleanQuery.Builder builder = new BooleanQuery.Builder();
builder.add(categoryQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
builder.add(priceQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
Query query = builder.build();



Display Facet Counts:

Use IndexReader to count the occurrences of each facet value.


Terms terms = MultiFields.getTerms(reader, "category");
TermsEnum termsEnum = terms.iterator();
while (termsEnum.next() != null) {
    System.out.println(termsEnum.term().utf8ToString() + ": " + termsEnum.docFreq());
}



2. Autocomplete
Autocomplete provides suggestions as users type their queries.

Steps to Implement Autocomplete
Index Prefixes:

Tokenize product names and descriptions into prefixes for autocomplete.
Use an analyzer like EdgeNGramTokenizer to generate prefixes.


doc.add(new TextField("autocomplete", product.getName(), Field.Store.YES));

Configure the EdgeNGramTokenizer:

Analyzer autocompleteAnalyzer = new CustomAnalyzer.Builder()
    .withTokenizer("edge_ngram", "minGram=1,maxGram=20")
    .build();


Query Prefixes:

Use PrefixQuery to match the user's input.


Query autocompleteQuery = new PrefixQuery(new Term("autocomplete", userInput));
TopDocs results = searcher.search(autocompleteQuery, 10); // Top 10 suggestions


Display Suggestions:

Retrieve and display matching product names.

for (ScoreDoc hit : results.scoreDocs) {
    Document doc = searcher.doc(hit.doc);
    System.out.println("Suggestion: " + doc.get("autocomplete"));
}


3. Aggregations for Filtering and Sorting
Aggregations allow you to group and summarize data (e.g., average price, count by category).

Steps to Implement Aggregations
Index Fields for Aggregation:

Ensure numeric fields like price are indexed using LongField.


doc.add(new LongField("price", product.getPrice(), Field.Store.YES));


Perform Aggregations:

Use IndexReader to iterate over documents and calculate aggregations.
Example:

long totalPrice = 0;
int count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < reader.maxDoc(); i++) {
    Document doc = reader.document(i);
    String priceStr = doc.get("price");
    if (priceStr != null) {
        totalPrice += Long.parseLong(priceStr);
        count++;
    }
}
double averagePrice = (double) totalPrice / count;
System.out.println("Average Price: " + averagePrice);


Sort Results:

Use Sort to sort results by numeric or text fields.
Example:


Sort sort = new Sort(new SortField("price", SortField.Type.LONG, false)); // Sort by price (ascending)
TopDocs results = searcher.search(query, 10, sort);


Example Workflow
Faceted Search:

User selects "Electronics" category and filters by price range (500-1000).
Query combines TermQuery for category and RangeQuery for price.
Autocomplete:

User types "Smart" and gets suggestions like "Smartphone X", "Smartwatch Y".
Aggregations:

Display average price of products in the "Electronics" category.
Sort results by price or relevance.


Benefits
Faceted Search: Helps users narrow down results based on attributes.
Autocomplete: Improves user experience with real-time suggestions.
Aggregations: Provides insights into product data and enables sorting/filtering.



Considerations
Performance:
For large datasets, consider using caching or precomputing facet counts and aggregations.
Scalability:
Lucene is not distributed by default. For large-scale e-commerce sites, Elasticsearch might be a better choice.
Custom Analyzers:
Use custom analyzers for better tokenization and indexing.
